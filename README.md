# Coop

Coop is an iOS application created during the Spring 2016 Hackathon at the University of Arkansas.

Original idea:
Create an application that can connect with another individual and play basic board games while saving moves and game status.

End result:
No server, database, internet connectivity was created due to the 22-hour time constraint.

The application currently has two working portions, tic-tac-toe and connect4, and one in progress, battleship.
Both working games, the player will compete against an artificial intelligence.
